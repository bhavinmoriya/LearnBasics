Great question üëå let‚Äôs break it down with simple examples.
When you execute a query with `sqlite3`, you get back a **cursor** that lets you iterate over rows.
The main ways to get results are:

---

### üîπ `fetchone()`

* Returns **the next row** from the result set.
* Each row is a **tuple**.
* Returns `None` if there are no more rows.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")   # in-memory DB for demo
cur = conn.cursor()

# Create demo table
cur.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)")
cur.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)", (1, "Alice"))
cur.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)", (2, "Bob"))
conn.commit()

# Query
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

print(cur.fetchone())  # (1, 'Alice')
print(cur.fetchone())  # (2, 'Bob')
print(cur.fetchone())  # None (no more rows)
```

---

### üîπ `fetchall()`

* Returns **all remaining rows** as a list of tuples.
* If no rows, returns an empty list `[]`.

```python
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
rows = cur.fetchall()
print(rows)  # [(1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob')]
```

---

### üîπ `fetchmany(size)`

There‚Äôs also `fetchmany(n)` which gives you a list of at most `n` rows.

```python
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
print(cur.fetchmany(1))  # [(1, 'Alice')]
print(cur.fetchmany(1))  # [(2, 'Bob')]
print(cur.fetchmany(1))  # []
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to keep in mind

1. `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, and `fetchmany()` **consume** the results ‚Äî once you fetch them, they‚Äôre gone.
   If you call `fetchall()` first, then `fetchone()`, you‚Äôll get `None`.

2. Iterating is often better than using `fetchall()` if the result set is large:

   ```python
   cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
   for row in cur:
       print(row)  # each row is a tuple
   ```

üëâ Question for you:
Do you want to use these results mostly for **debugging/logging** (just print them out), or to **convert into objects / DataFrames**?
