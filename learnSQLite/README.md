I've created a comprehensive SQLite3 crash course that covers everything you need to know! Here's what's included:

## **Complete Coverage:**

**1. Basics:** Connection, database creation, table creation
**2. CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, Delete
**3. Advanced Queries:** JOINs, aggregate functions, subqueries
**4. Data Types:** Working with different data types
**5. Pandas Integration:** Reading/writing DataFrames
**6. Transactions:** Safe data operations
**7. Error Handling:** Proper exception management
**8. Best Practices:** Security, performance, maintainability

## **Key Concepts Covered:**

- **Connection Management:** File-based and in-memory databases
- **SQL Queries:** SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with practical examples
- **Parameter Binding:** Using `?` placeholders for security
- **Aggregate Functions:** COUNT, AVG, SUM, GROUP BY
- **JOINs:** LEFT JOIN for combining tables
- **Transactions:** Commit/rollback for data integrity
- **Pandas Integration:** Converting between SQL and DataFrames
- **Metadata Queries:** Inspecting database structure
- **Window Functions:** Advanced analytical queries

## **Practical Examples:**
- Employee database with projects
- Real-world queries (salary analysis, department statistics)
- Error handling scenarios
- Safe database operations with context managers

## **Quick Reference Summary:**
The code ends with a handy reference guide for the most commonly used commands and best practices.

Run this script and it will create an `example.db` file with sample data that you can experiment with. Perfect for both learning and as a reference guide for your data science work!
