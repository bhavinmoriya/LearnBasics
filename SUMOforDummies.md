# Basic flow of Simulation
- Get `.osm.pbf`
- Convert OSM to net.xml: `netconvert --osm-files your-map.osm.pbf -o network.net.xml`    
- Generate routes: `python3 $SUMO_HOME/tools/randomTrips.py -n network.net.xml -o routes.rou.xml`    
- sumo.cfg:
 ```xml
	<configuration>
	    <input>
	        <net-file value="network.net.xml"/>
	        <route-files value="routes.rou.xml"/>
	    </input>
	    <time>
	        <begin value="0"/>
	        <end value="1000"/>

# `randomTrips.py`
The file `randomTrips.py` is a utility script for [Eclipse SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)](https://eclipse.dev/sumo), a popular open-source traffic simulation package. Its main purpose is to **generate random trips** (vehicle or pedestrian routes) within a given road network, according to various customizable parameters and constraints.

### Core Purpose

- **Generates trips (start and end locations, optionally with intermediate waypoints) between random locations on a SUMO network.**
- These trips can be output as XML files for use in SUMO simulations.
- Can optionally run a route-finding tool (`duarouter` or `marouter`) to convert trips into actual routes on the network.

### Key Features

- **Supports vehicles and pedestrians:** Can generate trips for cars, buses, pedestrians, or custom vehicle classes.
- **Flexible trip generation:** Allows specification of minimum/maximum trip distances, randomization, edge weighting by length, speed, lanes, and more.
- **Flows and period control:** Can generate individual trips or flows (groups of trips with specified departure rates).
- **Edge selection and weighting:** Trip origins, destinations, and intermediate waypoints are chosen according to weightings (by length, lanes, speed, etc.) and you can restrict trips to certain edge types.
- **Validation:** Can optionally validate generated trips for connectivity using SUMO's routing tools.
- **Stops and intermodal trips:** Supports trips starting/ending at public transport stops or other infrastructure elements.
- **Additional customization:** Many command-line options for attributes, random factors, routes, output files, and more.

### How It Works

1. **Command-Line Parsing:** Parses a wide range of command-line options to configure trip generation.
2. **Network Loading:** Loads the SUMO network (from an XML file) and parses its edges and nodes.
3. **Edge Weight Calculation:** Calculates probabilities for each edge to be chosen as a source, destination, or intermediate, based on user-specified weighting schemes.
4. **Trip Sampling:** Randomly samples source and destination edges (and optionally intermediates) according to calculated weights, while enforcing distance and other constraints.
5. **Trip Writing:** Writes trips in SUMO's XML format to an output file. Optionally, runs a routing tool to generate route files.
6. **Validation (optional):** Uses SUMOâ€™s routing tools to check if generated trips are valid and can be routed successfully.
7. **Advanced Features:** Supports person trips, flows, probability distributions for departures, and integration with additional infrastructure files.

### Example Use Cases

- **Generate a set of random vehicle trips for a traffic simulation scenario.**
- **Create random pedestrian flows for walkability studies.**
- **Benchmark routing algorithms with randomized trip sets.**
- **Simulate public transport usage by generating trips between stops.**

### Common Usage

Typically run via command line, e.g.:
```sh
python randomTrips.py -n network.net.xml -o trips.trips.xml --begin 0 --end 3600 --flows 100
```
This would generate 100 flows of random trips across the network for one hour.

**In summary:**  
`randomTrips.py` automates the creation of random trips and/or flows in a SUMO road network, supporting a wide range of customizations and constraints, to facilitate realistic traffic simulation scenarios.

## Various flags in `randomTrips.py`
The command `python3 $SUMO_HOME/tools/randomTrips.py` is used in **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)** to generate random vehicle trips for traffic simulations. This script is part of the SUMO toolchain and helps create realistic traffic demand by generating routes, departures, and vehicle types randomly.

---

### **What Does `randomTrips.py` Do?**
- Generates random trips (routes) for vehicles in a SUMO simulation.
- Outputs files like:
  - `.rou.xml` (routes)
  - `.trips.xml` (trips)
  - `.vtype.xml` (vehicle types, if specified).
- Can be customized with options for vehicle types, departure times, and route distributions.

---

### **Basic Usage**
```sh
python3 $SUMO_HOME/tools/randomTrips.py -n your_network.net.xml -o trips.trips.xml
```
- `-n`: Specifies the SUMO network file (`.net.xml`).
- `-o`: Output file for trips (default: `trips.trips.xml`).

---

### **Common Options**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-n <network_file>` | SUMO network file (required). |
| `-o <output_file>` | Output file for trips (default: `trips.trips.xml`). |
| `--begin <time>` | Start time for departures (default: `0`). |
| `--end <time>` | End time for departures (default: `3600` = 1 hour). |
| `--period <seconds>` | Time between departures (default: `1`). |
| `--validate` | Validate routes (ensure they are valid in the network). |
| `--vehicle-class <class>` | Restrict to a vehicle class (e.g., `passenger`, `truck`). |
| `--vtype <vtype_file>` | Use a custom vehicle type file. |
| `--route-files <route_file>` | Output route file (`.rou.xml`). |
| `--fringe-factor <float>` | Factor for fringe routes (default: `1.0`). |
| `--min-distance <meters>` | Minimum route distance (default: `0`). |

---

### **Example: Generate Trips for 1 Hour**
```sh
python3 $SUMO_HOME/tools/randomTrips.py \
  -n my_network.net.xml \
  -o my_trips.trips.xml \
  --begin 0 \
  --end 3600 \
  --period 2 \
  --validate
```
- Generates trips for 1 hour (`3600` seconds).
- Departures every 2 seconds.
- Validates routes.

---

### **Example: Generate Routes for Passenger Cars**
```sh
python3 $SUMO_HOME/tools/randomTrips.py \
  -n my_network.net.xml \
  --route-files my_routes.rou.xml \
  --vehicle-class passenger \
  --vtype my_vehicles.vtype.xml
```
- Outputs routes to `my_routes.rou.xml`.
- Only generates passenger cars.
- Uses custom vehicle types from `my_vehicles.vtype.xml`.

---

### **Notes**
1. **SUMO_HOME**: Ensure the environment variable `SUMO_HOME` is set to your SUMO installation directory.
2. **Dependencies**: Requires Python 3 and SUMO tools.
3. **Validation**: Use `--validate` to avoid invalid routes.
4. **Customization**: For advanced use, combine with `duarouter` or `jtrrouter` for dynamic routing.
